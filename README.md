### 🔹 8. OCR (Image & Text-to-Record Conversion)
```bash
git checkout -b feature/ocr-records
# Integrate OCR (pytesseract) for extracting text from images
```
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Added OCR feature for scanned records"
git push origin feature/ocr-records
```

### 🔹 9. AI-Powered Record Summarization
```bash
git checkout -b feature/ai-summarization
# Implement text summarization using sumy/transformers
```
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Added AI-powered record summarization"
git push origin feature/ai-summarization
```

### 🔹 10. Export & Share Records (PDF & Email)
```bash
git checkout -b feature/export-pdf-email
# Implement PDF generation using reportlab
# Add email functionality
```
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Enabled record export as PDF and email"
git push origin feature/export-pdf-email
```

### 🔹 11. Security Enhancements & Data Protection
```bash
git checkout -b feature/security-enhancements
# Implement encryption for sensitive data
# Add audit logs for tracking record changes
```
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Enhanced system security and data protection"
git push origin feature/security-enhancements
```

### 🔹 12. Testing & Debugging
```bash
git checkout -b feature/testing-debugging
# Write unit tests
# Conduct load testing and fix bugs
```
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Added tests and debugged errors"
git push origin feature/testing-debugging
```

### 🔹 13. Deployment & Documentation
```bash
git checkout -b feature/deployment
# Deploy system to cloud (AWS/DigitalOcean/Heroku)
# Write user and developer documentation
```
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Prepared for deployment and added documentation"
git push origin feature/deployment
```

## 🚀 Final Steps
Once all features are merged and tested, prepare for the final release:
```bash
git checkout main
git merge feature/database-models
...
git merge feature/deployment
git push origin main
```

🎉 **Congratulations! The SRRS is now live and ready for use.** 🚀
